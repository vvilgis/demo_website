This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
```{r carsggplot, fig.cap="A simple ggplot of car speed vs distance."}
#install.packages('plotly')
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = cars, aes(x=speed, y=dist, color=speed)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r plotlycars, echo=FALSE}
ggplotly(
  ggplot(data = cars, aes(x=speed, y=dist, color=speed)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
  )

```
